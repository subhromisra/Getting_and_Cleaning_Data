The script prepares a tidy data with the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

The R script Run_Analysis.R satisfies the following below requirements

    1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set - dataframe 'combinedSet' satisfies this requirement
     2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement - dataframe 'meanStd' satisfies the requirement
     3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set - dataframe 'resultSet' satisfies the requirement
     4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names - dataframe 'resultSet' satisfies the requirement
     5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject - dataframe 'cleanDataset' is the final tidy data.

The final clean and tidy data cleanDataset is then written into a text file as output.
